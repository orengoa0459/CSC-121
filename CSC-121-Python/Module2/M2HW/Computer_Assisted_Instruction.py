# Description: This program is designed to help elementary school students(grades 2+), learn
# multiplication. The program consist of 3 difficulty levels (beginner,intermediate,expert)
# and 3 sub levels (level 1,2,3). When the user selects their difficulty level they
# will be prompted to select a sub category level. Each multiplication game consists
# of 10 problems. Users will be given a designated number of retries per difficulty
# level. Once the user completes the 10 problems, the score will be displayed.
