# Description: This program ask the user to input the total amount of numbers they would
# like to add to the list. The user will be prompted to enter their numbers.
# Upon completion, the program will display all the numbers in the list, the minimum
# and maximum number, total of all numbers, and the average number in the list.

#Pseudocode
#1. Define main function and declare and initialize variables, sentinel, and list.
#2. Define function to get numbers from user.
#3. Define function to display main menu to user.
#4. In the main function, create a loop for the main menu. Get input from the user and
# and parse the string to an int. You will use the list and number as arguments in the
# get number function. 
#5. In the get number function, add a loop to get 10 numbers from the user. Each number
#will be inserted into the list until 10 numbers have been added.
#6. After the user inputs all numbers into the list, the numbers in the list will be
#displayed to the user. 
#7. The min/max number, total of numbers, and average number will also be displayed to
# the user.
